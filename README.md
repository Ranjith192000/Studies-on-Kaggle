# Studies and Exercises on Kaggle Kernels
Here you will find python notebook or R scripts where I developed exercises or studies aimed at data science cases and machine learning.

The subjects include a summary of concepts, techniques and methods applied in order to support future references to similar cases.

I will include new materials as new cases have been developed. Competition materials and other developments continued to be placed in other repositories.

Below is a brief summary of each case, more details can be found in the README.MD of each solution, as well as inside the materials themselves.

# [Wine](https://github.com/mgmarques/Studies-on-Kaggle/tree/master/Wines) Type and Quality Classification   [![image](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/templates/images/logoen.PNG)](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/)

A python Notebbok to analyze the physicochemical attributes of wine and understand their relationships and significance with wine quality and types classifications. To do this, We will proceed according to the standard Machine Learning and data mining workflow models like the CRISP-DM model, mainly for:
- Predict if each wine sample is a red or white wine.
- Predict the quality of each wine sample, which can be low, medium, or high.

The dataset are related to red and white variants of the "Vinho Verde" wine. Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer). This dataset is public available for research purposes only, for more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine5.pdf). . Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

# [CNN Exercise](https://github.com/mgmarques/Studies-on-Kaggle/tree/master/CNN) - Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This python notebook explore convolutional neural networks through the task of image classification using publicly dataset CIFAR-10. We will utilize our understanding of CNNs to then take on the task of style transfer and understand how neural networks can be used to understand high-level features. Through this notebook, we cover the following topics:

- Image classification use CNNs from scratch
- Transfer learning: image classification using pretrained models

# [Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/mgmarques/Studies-on-Kaggle/tree/master/CS_MBA)
![image](http://denary.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/picture_market_segmentation-10-4-13-resized-600.png)

This notebook we using publicly dataset On-line Retail to explore customer segmentation through the interesting task  of unsupervised learning method. Then we go further and apply association rule mining approach to find interesting rules and patterns in this transaction database. These customer segmentation, rules and patterns can be used to make interesting and useful decisions as far as user interest is concerned. 

The [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#) a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

# [Recommendation Engines Systems Basis](https://github.com/mgmarques/Studies-on-Kaggle/tree/master/million-song-recommendation-engines)
![image](http://www.btobet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/omni-img.jpg)

This notebook uses the user-song play count dataset to uncover different ways in which we can recommend new tracks to different users. We will start with a very basic system and try to evolve linearly into a sophisticated recommendation system.
